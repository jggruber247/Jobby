# Jobby
Jobby (name subject to change) is a job search management and organization tool. 
I intend to work on it as a side project for the purpose of gaining experience, and hopefully creating a tool that will help me with my own job search.

This is the web application version. It uses .php scripts with .css styling, and I run it using XAMPP for Windows. SQL is used for handling the database.
If I can get this working, I might create another version in Java down the line. Maybe I'll call that one "Jobby: JAVA edition."
